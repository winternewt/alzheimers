I wanna explore druggable Alzheimer targets. 
Let's start from a longevity perspective, what genes are associated with Alzheimer's?
Write the discoveries into alheimer_longevity.md

Interesting! None of the genes/proteins commonly associated with Alzheimer's showed up! Like Amyloid-beta, TAU, APOE, TERM2
Maybe check for anti-longevity genes in your query then?

Huh, let's proceed with an unconventional approach and explore your hypothesis that traditional Alzheimer's Genes Are Anti-Longevity
Check what we have on each of those in SynergyAge, if you're right we should see some antagonism with at least some of these.
Write findings into synergy_antagonism.md

Well yeah, apparently you're onto something here with the AMPK pathway. Ampakines seem to be a novel trend in AD drug research. Let's switch to traditional targets and see how that fits the puzzle. Dig stuff on traditional targets, especially pathways.

Metformin for AMPK activation you say? Okay, get me info on metformin pharmacology and write out anything that's related to Alzheimer's

Let's explore pathology next. I wanna know how far our A-beta and TAU are from that of the other species. First, fetch me the gene sequences for homo sapiens.
 Write them in separate files in species-named folders, focus on Amyloid beta of humans for now.

DONT ASK FOR MAPT SEQUNCE - > infinite loops. Ask for protein. 

Ok, I saved MAPT myself from your outputs. Bring the protein sequnce for human MAPT

Now get MAPT protein for mouse.
Blast human’s MAPT with limit 5.

Align what you got for mouse and human (didn’t succeed)
