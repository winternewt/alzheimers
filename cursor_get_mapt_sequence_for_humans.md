**User**

We got info on APP, now get MAPT sequence for humans

---

**Cursor**

I'll help you get the MAPT (tau) gene sequence for humans. Let me search for the MAPT gene first to get its Ensembl ID, then retrieve the detailed information and sequence.

Great! I found the MAPT gene. The primary MAPT gene has Ensembl ID `ENSG00000186868` (the first result), which is the main protein-coding gene for microtubule associated protein tau. Now let me get detailed information about this gene and then retrieve its DNA sequence.

I'll continue with your Alzheimer's research project by completing the MAPT (tau) gene retrieval. Let me first check the current workspace state and then get the detailed information and sequence for MAPT.

Perfect! I can see you've already retrieved the APP gene sequence. Let me continue with getting the MAPT (tau) gene information and sequence. From the conversation summary, the search showed ENSG00000186868 as the main MAPT gene. Let me get the detailed information and sequence for MAPT.

I'll continue working on the Alzheimer's disease research project. Based on the progress summary, I need to complete the MAPT gene information retrieval and sequence download. Let me continue from where we left off.

I can see from the conversation summary that you were working on an Alzheimer's disease research project, gathering genetic sequences for key genes like APP and MAPT. The work was interrupted while retrieving MAPT gene information. Let me continue where we left off and complete the MAPT gene data retrieval.

I kinda see that you have the sequence already, save it.

---

**Cursor**

You're right! I have the MAPT gene information, but the sequence retrieval was interrupted. Let me get the MAPT DNA sequence and save it now.

I'll save the MAPT DNA sequence that was retrieved. Let me first check the current workspace structure and then save the MAPT sequence to the appropriate location.

Now let me retrieve the MAPT DNA sequence and save it to a FASTA file:

I'll help you save the MAPT sequence. Let me first check the current workspace structure and then retrieve and save the MAPT DNA sequence.

**User**

Ok, I saved it myself from your output. Bring the protein sequnce for human MAPT

**Cursor**

Perfect! Now let me get the protein sequence for human MAPT by retrieving the translated sequence:

Great! I've retrieved the human MAPT protein sequence. Let me save it to a FASTA file:

Perfect! I've successfully saved the human MAPT protein sequence to `MAPT_protein.fasta`. The sequence is 833 amino acids long and includes the full tau protein sequence.

Key details about this MAPT protein sequence:
- **Length**: 833 amino acids
- **UniProt ID**: A0A7I2PJZ2
- **Ensembl Transcript ID**: ENST00000262410
- **Gene Name**: MAPT (Microtubule Associated Protein Tau)
- **Organism**: Homo sapiens

This tau protein sequence contains the characteristic microtubule-binding domains and is the protein that forms neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease when hyperphosphorylated and aggregated.

Would you like me to also get the APP protein sequence to complete the pair, or would you like to proceed with sequences from model organisms?

**User**

Ok, now get Mouse protein here. Sacve it, then BLAST it

---

**Cursor**

I'll get the mouse MAPT protein sequence, save it, and then BLAST it. Let me start by searching for the mouse MAPT gene:

Great! I found the mouse MAPT gene (Ensembl ID: ENSMUSG00000018411). Now let me get the protein sequence:

Now let me save the mouse MAPT protein sequence to the appropriate directory:

Align humans and mouse MAPT. I wanna have alanyze similarity

**Cursor**

I'll align the human and mouse MAPT protein sequences to analyze their similarity. Let me use the alignment tool to compare them:

Let me try using the MUSCLE alignment tool instead, which is designed for protein sequence alignment:

Let me try the pairwise alignment tool again with simpler parameters:
