# Human (Homo sapiens) Gene Information Summary

## APP Gene (Amyloid Precursor Protein)

### Ensembl ID: ENSG00000142192
- **Gene Symbol**: APP
- **Full Name**: Amyloid Precursor Protein
- **Chromosome**: 21
- **DNA Sequence**: Saved to `APP_DNA.fasta`
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully retrieved

### Next Steps
1. Get MAPT (tau) gene sequence for humans
2. Get protein sequences for both genes
3. Move to model organisms (mouse, rat, C. elegans, Drosophila)
4. Perform comparative analysis

## Notes
- APP is located on chromosome 21, which is relevant for Down syndrome and early-onset Alzheimer's
- This gene encodes the amyloid precursor protein that gets cleaved to form amyloid-beta peptides
